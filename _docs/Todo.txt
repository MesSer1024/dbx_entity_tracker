Bugs:
[x]	"state-files" are saved in AutoBuild-folder for content creators, whenever they sync this is nuked, should be saved somewhere else...
[]	Opening a SoldierWeaponBlueprint should open it with "Object Editor" instead of frosted-default "GearEditor"
[]	Seems like we sometime ends up with a 'tech hang' when loading a file, awikstrom had 10min delay on 'loading file'-screen
		Unknown what causes this, some kind of issue with s_worker inside entity explorer.cs?

Features:
[]	Parse items when computer has been idle (to avoid initial delay of 5min)
[]	Save/Serialize items with other technique than json (avoid crash when saving tons of things)
[]	Improve UI
[]	Implement tracking of usage and 'important stuff' to ease debugging, possible to show by pressing a view/menu or something (Debug output/Screen)
[]	Possible to e-mail that debug-output by pressing a button
